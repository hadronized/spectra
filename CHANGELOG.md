# 0.12.0

> Sunday, May, 6th 2018

- Migrated to `warmy-0.7`.

# 0.11.0

> Monday, April, 9th 2018

- Change the way to import modules in cheddar. One doesn’t use `from … import (…, …)` anymore, but
  the easier syntax `use … (…, …)`.
- Made `ModuleFold` and `Module::to_glsl_setup` public so that people can use it if they want. This
  change is an anticipation for the soon-to-be extracted `cheddar` (into its own crate).
- Remove the plugin system. It was way too much experimental and hacky. We might introduce it back
  when Rust has a decent JIT support.
- Since the plugin system was removed, a lot of transitive crates were also removed, making the
  crate lighter and faster to download / compile.
- Re-implement the shader system to fix with diamond importing. Also, a _bug_ that prevented a
  shader from re-compiling when a dependency changed was fixed in the same time.
- `ImportList` can now be converted to dependency keys.
- Enhanced a little bit the documentation.
- Make the `module` parser use a list of ModuleSymbol instead of ModulePath. This shouldn’t change
  much for you but it makes the parser more correct about what symbols it’ll accept.
- Remove `rusttype` crate dep. This will be needed in the future when we want to add text support,
  but as for now, it’s unused and adds unnecessary download / compile times.
- Various internal changes.

## 0.10.2

- Add `impl_load_json_via!`.

## 0.10.1

- Fix macro that requires `extern crate warmy`.

# 0.10.0

- Resource module cleanup.
- Add some resource helpers for some common encoding (for now, **JSON**).

## 0.9.1

- Added experimental plugins. Those are not production-ready yet as it’d be better to have a `rustc`
  JIT compiler instead.
- Some minor and convenient additions.

# 0.9.0

- Migrated to `warmy-0.5.2`.

## 0.8.1

- Fixed the fragment shader stage when the previous struct has only one field.

# 0.8.0

- Supported for luminance-0.25.0.

## 0.7.1

- Fixed modules dependencies gathering.
- Various internal patches in Cheddar.

# 0.7.0

- Exposed a framerate limit in CLI.
- Updated all the dependencies.
- Added Gitter badge.
- Enhanced a little bit the documentation (yet still very bad).
- Some internal fixed about `bootstrap::Device::events`.
- All the hot-reloading resource code now lives in the [warmy](https://crates.io/crates/warmy)
  crate.
- The Cheddar shading language is now the default – and only – way to build shaders.
- Internal refactoring.

# 0.6

- New resource system, with types keys, lasers, ninja and shit.

# 0.5

- Support for luminance-0.22.
- Changed the way models are handled (`ModelTree` and `MaterialTree`).

## 0.4.3

## 0.4.2

- Support for serde{,-*}-1.0.
- Support for image-0.13.

## 0.4.1

- Support for luminance-glfw-0.3.

# 0.4

- Implemented canonicalized resource cache. Such a cache can now fail when you create it if the root
  path doesn’t exist. All resources are internally stored in a canonicalized way so that no
  ambiguities can occur.

# 0.3

- `ResCache::get_proxied` now returns `Result<_>` as well if the path points to something that
  doesn’t exist (hot-reloading won’t work for that).

## 0.2.6

- Hot reloading fix (especially, it works on Mac OSX now).

## 0.2.5

- luminance-0.2.5 fix.

## 0.2.4

- Added `From / Into` impls for `[[f32; 4]; 4]` for `Transform`.

## 0.2.3

- `ResCache::get_proxied` doesn’t return an `Option<T>` anymore but a `T`, as it should.

## 0.2.2

- Made all `TextureImage`’s fields pub.

## 0.2.1

- Added several constructors for `Program`. Among them, `from_bufread` and `from_str`.
- Added `ResCache::get_proxied`, which takes an extra argument (regarding `ResCache::get`), a
  closure, used to compute a proxy value that will be used if resource loading fails.

# 0.2

- Added a `bootstrap!` macro used to build a `Device` in a very simple way (relying on clap).
- Fixed docs.rs link.
- luminance-glfw integration.
- Removed texture handling from the compositor and simplified it a lot.
- Switched to cgmath and dropped nalgebra.
- Refactored all spectra code according to typed programs (luminance).

# 0.1

- Initial revision.
